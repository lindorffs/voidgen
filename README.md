# Usage
You can download the current unstable version of the engine from the releases page.

VoidGEN loads the file `pre_init.lua` from the current working directory. If this file does not exist, or an update() and render() are not defined after this file executes, the engine will fail.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/lindorffs/voidgen-2.0/wiki) for more information on using the engine.
